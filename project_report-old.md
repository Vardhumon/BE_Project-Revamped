## ABSTRACT

CodeWorked Park is an innovative web-based platform designed to revolutionize collaborative code learning through community-driven engagement. The platform leverages modern web technologies and machine learning to create an interactive environment where developers can share, learn, and collaborate on coding projects. By incorporating features such as project sharing, real-time collaboration, and automated project rating systems, CodeWorked Park addresses the growing need for practical, community-oriented coding education.

The project utilizes a full-stack architecture, combining React for the frontend, Node.js with Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data persistence. The platform implements advanced features such as real-time commenting systems, project star ratings, and community-based organization of content. Through the integration of user authentication, project management, and interactive feedback mechanisms, CodeWorked Park creates a comprehensive ecosystem for code learning and sharing.
